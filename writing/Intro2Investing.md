# Investing and Saving Money in Canada.

If you start doing research on investing, they&#39;ll always state something like you need a goal for the investing. In fact, the road of personal finances is a bit more than investing and invest usually comes after budget, emergency fund, pay off high interest debt. If you pop over to personal finance reddit, you&#39;ll see a nice run down of steps in a personal finance journey [https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)

Based on what you said you&#39;ve got to the invest stage and are just looking at what to do with the cash you are accumulating. You are aware that the small percentage of interest being paid by your savings account is not up to inflation, and you are looking for investment options. Investing money can result in better returns on your money than a high interest savings account (which are usually lower than 2%), however investment products carry some risk.

I&#39;ll use the assumption that you are looking to save for &quot;retirement&quot;, which will take place when you turn 65, which is 22 years from now, so you have the ability to take some risk in the next 10 years or so, I&#39;ll get into how the risk works when I discuss investment products. I&#39;m also assuming that you don&#39;t have any open investment accounts such as a TFSA or RRSPs and that you make well over $100K/year, and will for the next several years.

## What you need to know to get started

The first thing to know is the difference between an _investing account_ and an _investment product_.

An investing account is a place where money **and** financial products are recorded. Your chequing and savings accounts only hold cash. An investment account can hold other products such as stocks, bonds, GICs, etc.

For example an investment account will show you own products;

- $3000 amount of cash
- 25 shares in Microsoft-
- 50 shares in the RBC special snowflake mutual fund.

## Investment accounts are either registered or not-registered.

Registered means Tax-Sheltered Accounts: In Canada the main ones are the TFSA and RRSP (there are others, but we&#39;ll ignore for now). Non-Registered, can still buy products but don&#39;t have special tax status.

TFSA and RRSP are registered with the government of Canada and the government of Canada agrees that any money inside of these accounts will not be subject to Capital Gains Tax.

### What is Capital Gains Tax?

Capital Gains tax is basically a tax the government charges for any money made through investing money. Currently &quot;Capital Gains&quot; are taxed at 50%, which means you need to add 50% of the realized capital gained to your income. Another way of putting it is that 50% of the capital gain will be taxed at your current marginal tax. Invested Money makes money in 3 main ways.

1. Dividends: Stocks and ETFs will pay out a small amount per stock, per year. A high dividend is over 5%. A 5% dividend on a stock worth $100, would pay $5 per year.
2. Price increase: If the investment is worth more than you bought it for and you sell it that is a capital gain. Ie. You buy a stock for $50, and sell it for $60, you made $10 in capital gains.
3. Interest paid to you on a bond or GIC.

Capital Gains Tax example:

You are in the 26% tax bracket, and you sell an investment product and make $10,000 in capital gains. $5,000, will be taxed at 26% which is $1300 to be paid in taxes.

As you can see, not paying capital gains tax is a pretty good deal.

What is the catch? There are limits on how much you can add to these accounts.

If you put more in than your allowed limit the government penalizes you by taxing the overage.

### TFSA: Your first stop

### The annual limit has changed over the years, but is usually between $5000 and $10,000. Lifetime limit also builds, so if you miss a year then that room is available in future years.

### If you have never put money in a TFSA you&#39;ll have about $80,000 in room (inception until now worth of room), you&#39;ll find the exact number on your tax return. This year I think you are allowed to add another $6000.

You can remove money from TFSA without penalty, and you get the contribution room back. So this is a good investment account to start with.

### RRSP

Contribution limited based on your earnings and has a max for the year. I think this year it was 18%, or $27,000ish whichever was lower. Your lifetime limit will be found on your most recent return, and is based on your lifetime earnings, but I guess for you it is also likely in the $80,000 range, if you haven&#39;t ever contributed.

RRSPs have an **extra bonus feature that the TFSA doesn&#39;t have**.

They allow you to defer the income tax on the money added to the account.

Defer you say… Why would I want to do that?

You&#39;d want to do this because Canada has a graduated tax system.

Roughly it looks like this:

First $50K is taxed at 15%, next $50K is taxed at 21%, next $50K is taxed at 26%, and so on. As you make more the tax on those blocks of money increases, so if you are making a high salary now, but a lower one in retirement, then deferring can be good deal.

However, this bonus feature comes with a bonus catch!

Early withdraw of money from an RRSP gets dinged by something called &quot;withholding tax&quot; – because second &quot;R&quot; in RRSP stands for &quot;retirement&quot;, generally this means age of 65 (there are some exceptions). Anyway, if you want the money before age 55 you have to pay not only the income tax but also extra tax called the withholding tax. This is why people often refer to RRSPs as &quot;locked in&quot; because you will be penalized for taking your own money back out of this account. As well RRSP contribution room is lost once the contribution is made (unlike TFSA).

The big take away here is that if you make less than $60K, the only reason to have an RRSP is if your TFSA is maxed out and you want to take advantage of the capital gains shelter in the RRSP and you know you don&#39;t need it until after 65.

**Ok now you know a little about investment accounts what next?**

## Make Money from Money

Using money to make money, requires you to &quot;purchase&quot; some sort of investment product.

Regardless of the products it will either be one of or a combination of these base products:

**Base Products:**

1. Stocks – buying a small piece or &quot;share&quot; of a company
2. Bonds – buying / making a small piece of a loan to a company (or government).
3. GICs – like a loan, so you get your principle back, and make a small amount of interest. (For closer to retirement.)
4. Real estate, commodities (gold, etc), (Don&#39;t worry too much about his category, I&#39;m just including it because yes there are things besides stocks/bonds.

You are not going to start out buying these you, will likely buy a product that combines the above.

**Combo Products**

**Mutual Fund** : A product that contains a bunch of stocks and bonds. The fund creates returns based on the stocks and bonds the fund owns, and that is managed by a person. You buy shares in the fund usually from a bank and pay an annual fee based on how much money you have invested, these fees are usually between 1% and 3%, depending on the bank. I have noticed that banks seem to be ok in misleading people into thinking that their &quot;investing account&quot; and their &quot;investment product&quot; are the same thing – ie they&#39;ll sell someone an &quot;RRSP&quot; – which is really a mutual fund inside of an RRSP.

**Exchange Traded Fund (ETF):** A product that contains a bunch of stocks and/or bonds. These funds are traded on some stock market, ie the TSX. Instead of buying from a bank, you buy and sell the shares directly on the stock exchange. The value and return of the ETF is based on the combination of the products that make up the ETF. There are 1000s of these things, so the only ones I&#39;ll go into detail on are something called index based ETFs. These are ETFs who model the mix of stocks on a specialized index such as the S&amp;P 500. An EFT like this will try to mimic the balance and generate the same return as the S&amp;P 500 index, this means there is very little in the way of human decisions made (which is good).

ETFs can pay dividends.

They charge an annual fee for the management known as the MER, and it is a percent of the amount you own in the fund. It is usually very low, like 0.25% and could be as low as 0.05%

## How to buy these products?

1. Get a financial planner pay them (either through fees, or percentage of your total account value) to open the account and buy the products. This is what happens when a bank sells you a mutual fund.
2. Use a &quot;Robo Advisor&quot;. These are new in the last few years, basically these are advisors that use algorithms or computer programs and buy a basket of low cost ETFs for you. You open a registered investment account with them, then tell them what &quot;risk level&quot;, or &quot;style&quot; of investing you want the &quot;robot&quot; to take and add money to the account and it invests it for you.
3. You open a self directed registered investing account, from your bank or one of the big trading platforms.

IF you choose self directed account you&#39;ll need to make a decision around what to buy. I would suggest buying low cost (low MER) index based exchange traded funds, or &quot;all in one fund&quot;, that is built from several index based ETFs. For the simplest, most straight forward all in one ETF is the Vanguard Balanced ETF, which trades under the code VBAL.

## Mindset of investing

Investing is a rabbit hole of information and there is always people promising wild gains. I think it is important to think about what you can control and what you can&#39;t control, because despite what anyone says the future is unknowable.

**What you can control;**

- How much you add to the account
- Taxes (sort of at least attempt to shelter)
- The cost of the investments / advisor you pay for.
- Risks

**What you can&#39;t control:**

- Performance and Earnings.

Knowing the above we want to be diligent about the frequency of savings. Try to shelter what we can. Reduce the costs of the investment products. Reduce the risk by choosing simple diversified vehicles.

## Suggested Course of Action

To be clear: I&#39;m not a financial advisor

It is probably a good idea to hire a fee for service financial advisor (that will cost money and time) but shopping for one of those could stop you from doing something now, and I would urge doing something rather than nothing. So if you want to get something going sooner than that, here are some self directed actions I&#39;d suggest.

Let&#39;s assume you have $40,000 to invest, and are confident you&#39;ll make $130K in salary in 2022.

## Step 1) Open a TFSA

Open a TFSA and add $28,000 to it.

**Self Directed Options**

1. RBC has direct investing. They charge $10 per trade, and have a few other nickel and dime fees one would expect from a big bank. Reviews seem to say they&#39;re meh, not great but no major redflags. The only reason to consider using them is that you already bank there and it will be slightly easier to transfer money in and out.
2. This is a very well known and large investing platform. They allow you to buy ETFs without any commission fees, and change lower fees for trading stocks. The platform is apparently easy to use and people seem to really like them. Sean uses this platform, and I&#39;ll be opening Abigail&#39;s RESP with them. What these guys want you to do is to become a retail stock trader, and get sucked into playing the market… but you won&#39;t do that. You&#39;ll just buy your ETFs for free and save a bunch of cash.

The biggest drawback of self directed is that you need to transfer money from your savings account into the investment account and make purchases a couple of times a year. The advantage is you can get lower fees, example you could buy just the VBAL ETF, and the MER would be just .024%

### Robo Advisor:

1. RBC InvestEase.
2. Questwealth (QuestTrade product)
3. Wealth Simple.

As mentioned above these guys do the trading for you. Their management fees are usually between 0.5% and 0.7%, on the portfolio.

The advantage here is that you can often set up an automatic savings plan where a set amount of money leaves your account and goes directly to the investment account. This is a good way to &quot;pay yourself first&quot; – ie you get paid the 1st and the 15th of the month, you have automatic transfers on the same days, so you never even see the money.

I actually think these are great products for the fees charged. Generally they buy the whole market and are much cheaper than mutual funds.

**Mutual Fund from RBC**

This will likely bring you in contact with some person who works in the bank, they&#39;ll talk about the returns but you need to know what the management fee is. It is usually over 1%, and can be as high as 3%. They are better than nothing but I would suggest if you don&#39;t want to do the research and take the self directed route, that you go with one of the Robo Advisors.

## Step 2: Open RRSP add the remaining $12,000

**I would recommend using the same option you used in step 1.**

If you make $135,000 in 2022 and contribute $12,000 you&#39;ll save about $4000 in taxes in your 2022 taxes. The math is a bit tricky, but it is roughly $300/$1000 contributed in Alberta.

## Step 3: Longer term

Set up savings plan that will max your TFSA room out over the next 5 years.

Adding some to your RRSP to get some taxes back. So about $16,000/year, and then the rest to your RRSP.
